by Ying Xu
# System-specific notes
Matlab R2016a, Tensorflow1.14 version, python3.7
# How to use it?
Firstly, run 1DCNN_DataPreparation.m and miniGCN_DataPreparation.m to generate data
1DCNN_DataPreparation:Generate training, validation, and testing datastes for the one-dimensional convolutional neural network
miniGCN_DataPreparation:Generate training, validation, and testing datastes for the one-dimensional mini-batch graph convolutional network
Then run 1DCNN+miniGCN_loss.py
